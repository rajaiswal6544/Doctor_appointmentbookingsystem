# Doctor Search & Appointment Booking System

## Overview
This project is a full-stack Doctor Search & Appointment Booking System built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It enables patients to search for doctors and book appointments while allowing doctors to manage their availability and appointments.

## Features
### 1. User Authentication & Role Management
- JWT-based authentication for Doctors and Patients.
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt.js.
- Patients can register/login and manage appointments.
- Doctors can register/login and set their availability.

### 2. Doctor Search & Profile Management
- Patients can search for doctors using filters:
  - Specialty (e.g., Cardiologist, Dermatologist).
  - Location (City, State).
  - Doctorâ€™s Name (partial match search).
- Doctor Profile Page displays:
  - Name, Specialty, Experience, Location, and Availability Slots.

### 3. Appointment Booking System
- Doctors set availability (working hours and consultation locations).
- Patients can book an available slot with a doctor.
- Concurrency handling to prevent double booking.
- Patients can cancel appointments.
- Email notifications for bookings and cancellations using Nodemailer.

### 4. Web Interface (Frontend)
- Responsive UI using React.js.
- **Patient Portal:**
  - Search for doctors.
  - Book or cancel appointments.
- **Doctor Dashboard:**
  - Set up consultation locations.
  - Define and update availability.
  - View upcoming appointments.
- Redux/Context API for state management.

<!-- ### 5. Deployment & Documentation
- Backend deployed using Render.
- Frontend deployed using Vercel / Netlify.
- Comprehensive documentation with API usage guide and sample requests. -->
